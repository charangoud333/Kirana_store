# Kirana Store Management System - Setup Guide

## Database Setup

The database schema has been automatically created in Supabase with the following tables:
- users (user profiles with roles)
- products (inventory catalog)
- purchases (stock-in records)
- sales (transaction records)
- sale_items (line items for sales)
- expenses (daily expenses)
- suppliers (supplier contacts)
- customers (customer credit accounts)
- payments (payment tracking)
- store_settings (store configuration)

## Creating the First Owner Account

Since this is your first time setting up, you need to create an owner account:

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Users
3. Click "Add user" and create a new user with:
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Password: your-secure-password
   - Confirm the email automatically
4. After creating the user, go to Table Editor > users table
5. Click "Insert row" and add:
   - id: (copy the user ID from auth.users)
   - role: owner
   - full_name: Your Name
   - status: active

### Option 2: Using SQL

Run this SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor (replace the values):

```sql
-- First, create the auth user (do this in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication)
-- Then insert the profile:
INSERT INTO users (id, role, full_name, phone, status)
VALUES (
  'USER_ID_FROM_AUTH_USERS',  -- Replace with actual user ID
  'owner',
  'Store Owner Name',
  '+91 98765 43210',
  'active'
);
```
